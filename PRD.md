**Acceptance:** Jest — `state.phase === 'team_setup'`, all team scores 0.

---

### TC-33 — Fastest Guess: faster time = higher score
**Given** two rounds with identical correct word count but different average times
**When** `calcRoundScore` is called with 'fastest_guess' mode
**Then** the faster round yields a higher score

**Acceptance:** Jest — `fastScore > slowScore`.

---

### TC-34 — No word repeated within a round
**Given** words are shuffled for a round
**When** the player plays through all words
**Then** no word appears twice in the session

**Acceptance:** Jest — word queue built with `buildWordQueue` + `shuffleArray` has no duplicates (Set size === array length).

---

### TC-35 — Swipe right triggers CORRECT (integration)
**Given** input mode is 'swipe'
**When** a right swipe of ≥ 60px is detected
**Then** `onCorrect` callback fires once

**Acceptance:** Manual / jsdom — simulate `touchstart` + `touchend` with `deltaX = 80`; callback invoked.

---

### TC-36 — Minimum swipe threshold rejects short swipes
**Given** input mode is 'swipe'
**When** a swipe of < 60px is detected

# Feature: A to Z Dhamaka (v1)

**Added:** Offline local multi-player pass-device word game. No Firebase.

## Overview

2–6 players are given a random letter and 4 categories. Each player gets 60 seconds (on their turn with the device) to tap words starting with that letter for each category. Players with unique valid answers score more than those who match others.

## Architecture

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| State machine | `reducer.js` | setup → round_active → reveal → round_end |
| Dictionary | `dictionary.js` | Word database per letter × category; hasWord() validation |
| Scoring | `scoring.js` | Unique = 10, Duplicate = 5, Invalid = 0; bonuses for all-valid / all-unique |
| Timer | `Timer.jsx` | 60s interval-based countdown using Date.now() |
| Screens | `SetupScreen`, `RoundScreen`, `RevealScreen`, `ResultScreen` | UI per phase |
| Top-level | `AtoZDhamaka.jsx` | useReducer + side-effect scoring on reveal |

## Features

### F42 — Setup
- 2–6 players with custom names

### F43 — Round Flow (Pass Device)
- Random letter drawn (A–Z, excluding hard letters)
- Random 4 categories selected from pool of 10
- Each player gets 60s on device to tap word suggestions per category
- Progress indicator shows which player is active (e.g. "Player 2 (2/3)")
- "Done" button to submit early; timer auto-advances on expiry
- Color-coded timer: normal → amber at 20s → red + pulse at 10s

### F44 — Reveal Phase
- All players' answers shown side by side
- Validation: word must start with letter and exist in dictionary
- Color-coded: green = unique valid, yellow = duplicate valid, red = invalid

### F45 — Scoring & XP
- Unique valid answer: 10 pts
- Duplicate valid answer: 5 pts
- Invalid: 0 pts
- Bonus: +5 if all 4 categories valid, +5 if all 4 unique
- XP: +1 per valid word, +3 for round winner

# Feature: High Score Tracking (v1)

**Added:** Per-game personal best stored in localStorage.

## Overview

Solo games track the player's all-time high score locally. Displayed on the setup screen before each session and celebrated on the result screen.

## Service

`src/services/highScores.js`

- `getHighScore(slug)` → `number | null`
- `setHighScore(slug, score)` → stores score + ISO date
- `checkAndUpdateHighScore(slug, score)` → `{ isNewRecord, previousBest }`

## Features

### F46 — Personal Best Display
- Setup screen shows "🏆 Personal best: X pts" in accent color (if record exists)
- Result screen shows previous best if not beaten ("Best: X pts")

### F47 — New Record Celebration
- Result screen shows "🎉 New Record!" with amber glow badge + bounce animation
- Applies to: Tez Hisab, Spot the Jugaad, Bollywood Emoji Guess

# Feature: Phase Transitions (v1)

**Added:** Subtle CSS animations between game phases.

## Overview

All game screens fade in when a phase changes. Buttons have press feedback. Win moments use a more prominent animation.

## Features

### F48 — Phase Fade-In
- Custom Tailwind keyframe: `fade-in` (opacity 0→1, translateY 6px→0, 0.18s ease-out)
- `FadeIn` wrapper component (`src/components/FadeIn.jsx`) applied to all game phase routers
- `key` prop set to phase name so re-mount triggers animation on phase change
- Gameplay phases (e.g. `question_show`/`answer_selected`) share same key to avoid re-animating within a question

### F49 — Button Press Feedback
- `Button.jsx` base class includes `active:scale-95` (95% scale on press)
- Provides tactile-feel without requiring any additional libraries
